# Learning Java Fundamentals ☕

This repository documents my journey through the **"Complete Java Course - Object-Oriented Programming"** by Dr. Nelio Alves. It focuses on solidifying my understanding of Java logic, Object-Oriented principles, and clean code practices.

## 🚀 Current Module: Git, Github & Data Persistence (JDBC)

I am currently mastering version control with Git and learning how to connect Java application to SQL databases using JDBC

### Implemented Exercises (based on URI Online Judge)
* **Exercise 01:** Logic to identify if a number is negative or not.
* **Exercise 02:** Checking whether an integer is Even or Odd.
* **Exercise 03:** Algorithm to determine if two numbers are multiples of each other.
* **Exercise 04:** Calculating game duration, including scenarios where the game starts on one day and ends on another
* **Exercise 05:** Implementing a price table system to calculate the total cost of items based on code and quantity.
* **Exercise 06:** Verifying numerical intervals (e.g., [0,25], (25,50], etc.).
* **Exercise 07:** Determining the quadrant of a point in a 2D Cartesian plane.
* **Exercise 08 (The Lisarb Problem):** A complex business logic for calculating Income Tax based on tiered salary brackets.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools
* **Java 21**
* **Spring Tool Suite 4 (STS4)**
* **Git & GitHub**
* **Maven**
