# Learning Java Fundamentals ☕

[cite_start]This repository documents my journey through the **"Complete Java Course - Object-Oriented Programming"** by Dr. Nelio Alves[cite: 1, 2]. It focuses on solidifying my understanding of Java logic, Object-Oriented principles, and clean code practices.

## [cite_start]🚀 Current Module: Conditional Structures (if-else) [cite: 3]

I am currently solving practical exercises to master decision-making logic and flow control in Java.

### [cite_start]Implemented Exercises (based on URI Online Judge)[cite: 4]:
* [cite_start]**Exercise 01:** Logic to identify if a number is negative or not[cite: 11, 13].
* [cite_start]**Exercise 02:** Checking whether an integer is Even or Odd[cite: 27, 29].
* [cite_start]**Exercise 03:** Algorithm to determine if two numbers are multiples of each other[cite: 42, 44].
* [cite_start]**Exercise 04:** Calculating game duration, including scenarios where the game starts on one day and ends on another[cite: 59, 61, 62].
* [cite_start]**Exercise 05:** Implementing a price table system to calculate the total cost of items based on code and quantity[cite: 76, 78, 79].
* [cite_start]**Exercise 06:** Verifying numerical intervals (e.g., [0,25], (25,50], etc.)[cite: 87, 89].
* [cite_start]**Exercise 07:** Determining the quadrant of a point in a 2D Cartesian plane[cite: 107, 109, 110].
* [cite_start]**Exercise 08 (The Lisarb Problem):** A complex business logic for calculating Income Tax based on tiered salary brackets[cite: 130, 134, 135].

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools
